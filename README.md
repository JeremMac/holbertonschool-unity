# All unity projects and experiments are in this repository.

## What is this repo?

Good day to you! This repository is a school repository. The goal of this repo is to learn and sharpen my skills with unity.
Different projects at different stage of their evolution can be found here. Only two of them are complete versions of the games.

## What are those projects?

Those games are little games created as said above using unity:

* **unity-animation**

     *It is a platformer 3D game project with all functional features.This version is the last and completed version of the game.*

* **unity_publishing**

     *This project is a labyrinth 3D game, completed and functionnal.*

## Platformer Game :

      As stated above, **unity-animation** contains a platformer game.

* Gameplay:

      using the directional arrows of the keybord, you have to jump from platforms to platform. The space key will allow you to jump.

* Goal:

      Try to reach the end of the parcour in the shortest time you can. To do so, you will have to reach the red flag.

* Levels:

      3 different levels are playable. The parcour will be different in every of these levels.

## Labyrinth game :

* Gameplay : 

        Using the arrow keys of the keyboard you can move a ball in a labyrinth and collect an amount of amount of coins around the place
        will avoiding traps.

* Goal :

        The player have to guide the ball around the labyrinth and reach the green square to win while avoiding red square. These are traps
        and will cause the player to lose HP.

* Color blind mode :

        As red and green could be problematique colors for colorblind people, a special mode is available to them so that everyone can enjoy the game.
	
## My personnal experience:

* From platformer :

        This little project was interesting to complete. It allowed me to aquire new knowledges and better understanding of Unity.
        There are solid basis in UI design, collider use, wining consitions, the use of asset, texture and materials in Unity and
        how they can react all together. Using animations in unity was also a big focus in this project and learning to animate a character
        and a starting cinematique was a rich experience as much as it was fun and satisfying to make simple, short but fluid animations.

* from labyrinth :
	
        Easier that the platformer, this project was a basis to learn player movement and input. How will the ball respond if you press a specific key?
        How does picking object works? how to implement a winning condition and reset the game if this condition is met? This are all the questions that this project
        made me ask myself. Short and simple , this project answered them all and seeing all the component act together made everything clear via pratice, trials and errors.

## challenges :

        having a comfortable way of moving the player around was something that i was afraid of at first because of how uneasy i felt about vectors. The picking object mechanic
        for the labyrinth and the jump mechanics for the platformer also seemed confusing at first to me. but he more i practiced the more it made sense.

## Technical difficulties :

        At some point in the platformer's creation, i experienced a terrible compatibility issue. The textures and materials wouldn't display correctly due to the fact that i had to change
        the unity version i was using med project. I feared i had to restart from scratch, but remember my peer @SpStigma whom i mentionned on my Github "biography"? He helped me by suggesting i create
        a new empty project with the targeted unity version, then transfere everything from the disfunctional project to the new one. It worked (obviously) and my project was saved!

## Non technical difficulties :

        One of the worst difficulties was my low self esteem. Yes it is not pretty in a github or a Cv! But i am also someone who hates lying! most of the time, what will be across your path will often be
        yourself. Not believing in your abilities to do something can be a little unproductive and lower your motivation. Fortunately this doesn't happen a lot because the more you accomplish the more confident you get.
        Again, dear @SpStigma was always supporting! having great peers and a good environement helps a lot too.


## My conclusion :
        If it was frustrating at time, accomplishing and completing these projects was a rich experience and gave me a lot of practice. It helped me get other my fear of vectors and helped me understand a lot of notions i thought
        "overcomplicated". What is the main lesson i remember from these project? Practice is the best of teachers and perseverance the highest of virtue.
