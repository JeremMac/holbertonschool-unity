# Unity ShaderGraph Project

## Description

This project aims to explore and create various shaders using Unity's ShaderGraph tool. You will learn to design shaders visually while having the creative freedom to adapt them to different styles (cartoon, realistic, pixelated, etc.). The shaders should be recognizable by a non-technical user, for example, a shader that simulates a glowing effect or water.

## Prerequisites

- **Unity Version**: Use Unity 2022 LTS or later.
- Familiarize yourself with the following resources:
  - [Watch: Shaders 101](#)
  - [Watch: Intro to ShaderGraph](#)
  - [ShaderGraph Documentation](#)
  - [Unity Manual: Unity’s Rendering Pipeline](#)
  - [Unity Manual: Asset packages](#)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external help:

- What is rendering?
- What is a render pipeline?
- What is Unity’s Scriptable Render Pipeline?
- What is a shader?
- What is ShaderGraph and how is it used?
- How to set up a new project that utilizes ShaderGraph?
- What is the difference between surface, vertex, and fragment shaders?
- What is UV mapping?
- What is vertex animation?


## Tasks

### 1. Pulse
- Create a shader where the glow pulses.
- Properties: Base color, Glow color, Minimum glow strength, Maximum glow strength, Pulse frequency.

### 2. Mr. Stark, I don't feel so good
